## Usage
Add prefab Console to scene! 
For it to work correctly, an EventSystem is needed in your scene.

### Toggle Commander
By default the component added to the prefab called <i>ToggleCommander</i> opens the console with <i>Enter</i> and closes the console with <i>Esc</i>. You can modify these keys for your convenience, and you can also remove this component if you want another component / object to handle the commander.

### Commands
You can create custom commands by extending the <i>ConsoleCommand</i> class. 
Then just add the command's scriptable object to the <i>Commander</i> component.

### Commandos de log
![LogTypes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/ExpressoBits/EBConsole/LogTypes.png)

It still has basic log commands that add messages to a panel below the console. These can be called up with:

```Logs.Instance.Log("Log Default");```

```Logs.Instance.LogWarning("Warning log");```

```Logs.Instance.LogError("Error log");```
